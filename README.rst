Keystone *Light*
================

*Always Smooth*

Keystone Light is a re-interpretation of the Keystone project that provides
Identity, Token and Catalog services for use specifically by projects in the
OpenStack family.


----------
Data Model
----------

Keystone Light was designed from the ground up to be amenable to multiple
styles of backends and as such many of the methods and data types will happily
accept more data than they know what to do with and pass them on to a backend.

There are a few main data types:

 * **User**: has account credentials, is associated with one or more tenants
 * **Tenant**: unit of ownership in openstack, contains one or more users
 * **Token**: identifying credential associated with a user or user and tenant
 * **Extras**: bucket of key-values associated with a user-tenant pair, typically used to define roles.

While the general data model allows a many-to-many relationship between Users
and Tenants and a many-to-one relationship between Extras and User-Tenant pairs,
the actual backend implementations take varying levels of advantage of that
functionality.


KVS Backend
-----------

A simple backend interface meant to be further backended on anything that can
support primary key lookups, the most trivial implementation being an in-memory
dict.

Supports all features of the general data model.


PAM Backend
-----------

Extra simple backend that uses the current system's PAM service to authenticate,
providing a one-to-one relationship between Users and Tenants with the `root`
User also having the 'admin' role.


Templated Backend
-----------------

Largely designed for a common use case around service catalogs in the Keystone
project, a Catalog backend that simply expands pre-configured templates to
provide catalog data.

Example paste.deploy config (uses $ instead of % to avoid ConfigParser's
interpolation)::

  [DEFAULT]
  catalog.RegionOne.identity.publicURL = http://localhost:$(public_port)s/v2.0
  catalog.RegionOne.identity.adminURL = http://localhost:$(public_port)s/v2.0
  catalog.RegionOne.identity.internalURL = http://localhost:$(public_port)s/v2.0
  catalog.RegionOne.identity.name = 'Identity Service'


---------------
Keystone Compat
---------------

While Keystone Light takes a fundamentally different approach to its services
from Keystone, a compatibility layer is included to make switching much easier
for projects already attempting to use Keystone.

The compatibility service is activated by defining an alternate application in
the paste.deploy config and adding it to your main pipeline::

  [app:keystone]
  paste.app_factory = keystonelight.keystone_compat:app_factory

Also relevant to Keystone compatibility are these sequence diagrams (openable

-----------
Still To Do
-----------

* Dev and testing setups would do well with some user/tenant/etc CRUD, for the
  KVS backends at least.
* Fixture loading functionality would also be killer tests and dev.
* LDAP backend.
* Keystone import.
